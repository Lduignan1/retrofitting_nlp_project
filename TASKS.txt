19 May. Anatolii, Nazanin, Liam: be able to explain what the project is about.
23 May. Anatolii, Nazanin: make a "skeleton" of the program, to_do steps, divide coding tasks.
        Liam: Theoretical background.
        
28 May. Anatolii, Nazanin: finish implementing functions that allow our retrofit program to run
        Liam: Research theoretical background on distributional semantics, word2vec, semantic lexicons; evaluation metrics
        
29 May. Anatolii, Nazanin: figure out what's causing program to get generate a few erratic values; 
        Liam: word similarity metric

30. May. Tasks left to do:
        - implement word similarity metric (Liam)
        - finish writing theoretical part (Liam)
        - slides for theoretical part (Liam)
        - python script for eval metrics
        - write implementation part (Nazanin)
        - slides implementation part (Nazanin)
        - write about experiments/results
        - slides experiments/results
        - write user manual/README
        - extracting data from PPDB/WN?
